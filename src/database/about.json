    "aboutText": "I'm Thiago, a developer since 2016, I started watching tutorial videos about programming and since then I haven't been able to stop studying about it, I took some courses at Udemy right after the release of PHP 7, so yes, PHP was my first contact with a language programming, I had previously studied programming logic with professor Gustavo Guanabara, who offers free courses on his channel. Currently I have been studying various technologies, ranging from HTML to the dreaded Java, as it was never my main activity, studying programming has become my hobby. This portfolio was made with the intention of changing that."
